## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* Border radius is sometimes not visible due to overflow issues
* Padding adds to a flex item's width since the default value for `box-sizing` is `content-box`
* How to apply a color filter on an image

### Continued development

* Need to refine the Mobile layout for this website
